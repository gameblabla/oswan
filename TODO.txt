- Improve the code : it's a mess. (seriously)
* I have converted most of the DWORD, WORD, BYTE as well as unsigned short, unsigned char etc...
to uint32_t, int32_t, int16_t, int8_t etc... I need to check for any regressions but it already fixed voices on hardware without FPUs.

- Sound is somewhat broken. On slow hardware, it can still skip after the buffer is filled for a while.

- Proper 32-bits support
On Linux, if the bpp is different from the display, it will be converted but there will be a significant drop in speed.
The only problem is the palette : it is not properly converted to 32 bits...
Look at emu/WSRender.c and SetPalette function for more info.

- Improve resolution support on computers
- Improve input code

- Eventually merge code with Dualswan. (Not sure if there are any benefits from doing so but according to its author, it runs like 20 FPS faster on the same hardware)
